Melee
============

WARNING: This is not a game (yet?). Not playable.

This is my attempt at creating a game, since I've not done one before - I'm an
embedded systems and desktop application developer, without formal games
programming training. Good artists create, but - as is abundantly clear by the
temporary assets I MSPainted - I am not a good artist, so I'm stealing the
mechanics from [The Ur-Quan Masters](http://sc2.sourceforge.net/) project.

So far I'm using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for the rendering, and modern
C++ for the "engine". I'm aware better solutions exist (Unity, Godot, etc.) but
I'm using this purely as an exercise to learn how a simple game might work
under the hood.
